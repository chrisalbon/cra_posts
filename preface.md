At the end of 21st century's first decade, the world's digital revolution was sparking political revolutions. The proliferation of communication technologies, from blogs to Twitter, and mobile phones to WiFi, opened new doors for pursuing social change. In a 2010 journal article, political scientist [Larry Diamond](http://www.stanford.edu/~ldiamond/) proposed a new definition for these tools: *liberation technology*, or "any form of information and communication technology (ICT) that can expand political, social, and economic freedom."

[Liberation technologies](http://www.amazon.com/Liberation-Technology-Struggle-Democracy-Journal/dp/1421405687) remain as relevant today as they were when Diamond first laid down the concept. However, a closely related field is only starting to receive attention by policymakers, researchers, and practitioners: the use of data for social good. With the digital revolution has come a data revolution, where data and the tools to understand it are more available than ever. Causes like [open government](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_government) and [open data](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_data) have developed to push for the release of (particularly public) data. However, these movements rest on a fundamental — but often unstated — assumption: the release and use of data can, like other liberation technologies, improve the human condition.

This is a blog and book-writing project about the use of data and data science for social good: what works and what doesn't; what we should know and what we can't know; what been done in the past and what we can do in the future. It is, put simply, about *liberation data*.
