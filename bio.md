**Short version:** I use data for social good. I also write about it.

**Longer version:** I am the Director of Data Projects at [Ushahidi](http://www.ushahidi.com), leading our work around the use of data in natural and man-made crises. Prior to Ushahidi, I was Director of the Governance Project at [FrontlineSMS](http://www.frontlinesms.com). Previously, I earned a Ph.D. in Political Science from the University of California, Davis researching the quantitative impact of civil wars on health care systems.

I write about liberation data and data science for social good at [ChrisRAlbon.com](http://chrisralbon.com). In 2008, I founded [Conflict Health](http://conflicthealth.com), a blog on the defense of health and health workers in armed conflict and political violence. I also wrote for the [Daily Dot](http://dailydot.com), [United States Naval Institute Blog](http://blog.usni.org), TheAtlantic.com, ForeignPolicy.com, [UN Dispatch](http://undispatch.com), and elsewhere.

I earned a B.A. from the University of Miami, where I triple majored in political science, international studies, and religious studies.

I code in [R](http://r-project.org) and [Python](http://python.org/), and write in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).
